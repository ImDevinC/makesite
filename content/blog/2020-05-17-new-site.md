### A new site, again
It's that time of the year again, where I redo my website from scratch because I wanted to try something different. Instead of going for something fancy this time though, I opted for a simple static site. This provides quite a few enhancements:

+ **Low bandwidth usage**: By removing any ReactJS, webcomponents, etc, the page loads significantly faster. I wasn't really using the benefits of all those libraries, so making my users load them just seemed ineffective.
+ **CASC**: A static site means I can easily keep my entire site as code, including my blog posts, news updates, and more. This makes keeping track of my updates significantly easier.
+ **Automated Releases**: Because I'm using CASC, it means I can have simple piplines that automatically run whenever I update my site. Make a new blog post, push the code, and the pipeline kicks off to generate an updated version of the static site.

For such a small site, having fancy components and such definitely adds some cool features, but a lot of times I spent more time focusing on making sure the pixels were perfect instead of sharing ideas. So here's to hopefully sharing more ideas!
